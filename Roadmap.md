# 📘 Data Structures Learning Roadmap

## 1. **Foundations**
Before diving into data structures, build a strong foundation.

- **Prerequisites**
  - Learn a programming language (C, C++, Java, or Python recommended).
  - Understand basic programming concepts:
    - Variables, loops, conditionals
    - Functions & recursion
    - Arrays and strings
    - Memory concepts (stack vs heap)

📚 *Resources*:  
- *Introduction to Programming in Python* or *C Programming Absolute Beginner’s Guide*  
- Online coding platforms (LeetCode, HackerRank)

Files:
- [[01-Foundations.md]]

---

## 2. **Introduction to Data Structures**
Start with the “why” before the “how.”

- What are data structures?
- Why do we need them?
- Trade-offs: **time complexity** vs **space complexity**
- Learn **Big-O notation**

📚 *Resources*:  
- “Big-O Cheat Sheet” (visual guides available online)  
- MIT OCW: *Introduction to Algorithms (6.006)*

Files:
- [[02-Introduction-to-Data-Structures.md]]

---

## 3. **Linear Data Structures**
Learn structures where data elements are arranged sequentially.

- **Arrays**
  - Static vs dynamic arrays
  - Applications (storing lists, matrices)
- **Linked Lists**
  - Singly, doubly, circular linked lists
  - Pros/cons compared to arrays
- **Stacks**
  - LIFO principle
  - Applications: undo operations, expression evaluation
- **Queues**
  - FIFO principle
  - Variants: circular queue, deque, priority queue

🛠 Practice: Implement from scratch in your language of choice.  
💡 Applications: Browser history (stack), task scheduling (queue)

Files:
- [[03-Linear-Data-Structures.md]]
- [[Arrays.md]]
- [[Linked-Lists.md]]
- [[Stacks.md]]
- [[Queues.md]]

---

## 4. **Non-Linear Data Structures**
Explore structures where data is hierarchical or networked.

- **Trees**
  - Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees (BSTs)
  - Traversals (inorder, preorder, postorder)
  - Heaps (min-heap, max-heap)
  - Balanced trees (AVL, Red-Black Trees)
- **Graphs**
  - Representations: adjacency list, adjacency matrix
  - Graph traversal: BFS, DFS
  - Applications: social networks, maps

🛠 Practice: Build a family tree, shortest path finder  
💡 Applications: Routing algorithms, compiler design

- [[04-Non-Linear-Data-Structures.md]]
- [[Trees.md]]
- [[Graphs.md]]

## 5. **Advanced Data Structures**
Once you are comfortable, move to more specialized structures.

- Hash Tables (hashing, collisions, open addressing)
- Tries (prefix trees)
- Disjoint Set / Union-Find
- Segment Trees, Fenwick Trees
- B-Trees and B+ Trees

💡 Applications:  
- Hash Tables → dictionaries, caches  
- Tries → autocomplete, spell-check  
- Segment Trees → range queries in games/databases  

Files:
- [[05-Advanced-Data-Structures.md]]
- [[Hash-Tables.md]]
- [[Tries.md]]
- [[Union-Find.md]]
- [[Segment-Trees.md]]
- [[Fenwick-Trees.md]]
- [[B-Trees-and-Bplus-Trees.md]]

## 6. **Algorithms with Data Structures**
Combine your data structure knowledge with algorithms.

- Sorting algorithms: quicksort, mergesort, heapsort
- Searching algorithms: binary search
- Graph algorithms: Dijkstra’s, Kruskal’s, Prim’s
- Dynamic programming and data structures together

Files:
- [[06-Algorithms-with-Data-Structures.md]]
- [[Sorting-Algorithms.md]]
- [[Searching-Algorithms.md]]
- [[Graph-Algorithms.md]]
- [[Dynamic-Programming.md]]

---

## 7. **Practical Applications & Projects**
Solidify your understanding by building projects.

- Implement a text editor with undo/redo (stacks)
- Build a simple database index (B-Trees)
- Social network graph analysis (graphs + BFS/DFS)
- Autocomplete search engine (tries)
- Memory allocator simulator (linked lists + heaps)

Files:
- [[07-Practical-Applications-and-Projects.md]]

---

## 8. **Interview & Competitive Programming Prep**
If you want to prepare for coding interviews:

- Master common problems on arrays, strings, stacks, queues
- Practice coding challenges daily
- Focus on time complexity analysis

📚 *Resources*:  
- *Cracking the Coding Interview* by Gayle Laakmann McDowell  
- *LeetCode Patterns* guide  

Files:
- [[08-Interview-and-Competitive-Programming-Prep.md]]

---

## 9. **Next Steps**
Once you’re confident:

- Explore **Parallel & Distributed Data Structures**
- Study **Data Structures in Machine Learning** (tensors, computational graphs)
- Learn about **persistent data structures** and **functional programming** approaches

Files:
- [[09-Next-Steps.md]]

✅ **Tip**: Always *implement data structures yourself first* before using built-in libraries. This gives deep intuition.
