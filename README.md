## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Follow the Learning Path
Start with the [Roadmap.md](Roadmap.md) for a structured progression:
1. **Foundations** - Programming basics and Big-O notation
2. **Linear Data Structures** - Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues
3. **Non-Linear Data Structures** - Trees, Graphs
4. **Advanced Structures** - Hash Tables, Tries, Segment Trees
5. **Algorithms Integration** - Sorting, Searching, Graph algorithms
6. **Practical Applications** - Real-world projects
7. **Interview Preparation** - Coding challenges and patterns

### 2. Explore Individual Topics
Browse the `topics/` directory for detailed explanations of specific data structures and algorithms. Topics use wikilink cross-references (`[[Topic-Name]]`) for easy navigation.

### 3. Practice with Assignments
Work through coding assignments in the `assignments/` directory:

```bash
# Run the stack assignment
cd assignments/stack/
python test_stack.py      # Run unit tests
python application.py     # See practical demonstrations
```

### 4. Create Presentations
Use the LaTeX Beamer template for creating educational content:

```bash
cd slides/BeamerTemplate/
pdflatex CleanEasy.tex    # Compile presentation
```

## 🛠️ Development Commands

### Running Assignments
```bash
# Navigate to any assignment directory
cd assignments/[assignment-name]/
python test_[assignment].py    # Run unit tests
python application.py          # Run demonstrations
```

### Creating Presentations
```bash
# Use the main template
cd slides/BeamerTemplate/
pdflatex CleanEasy.tex
latexmk CleanEasy.tex         # Alternative compilation

# Compile topic-specific presentations
cd slides/[Topic]/
pdflatex [topic].tex
```
